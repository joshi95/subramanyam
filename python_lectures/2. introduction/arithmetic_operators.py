PYTHON IDLE

REPL -> (READ Evaluate PRINT LOOP)

whenever you are using PYTHON IDLE or 
you type python in your terminal if python is
installed you will be greeted with REPL.

REPL is an experiment area where you 
can quickly run python commands. 


 +   addition
 -   subtraction
 *   mulitplication 
 /   division 
 //  integer division
 %   remainder

 

====================================

ODD / EVEN CHECK WE WILL DO % 2


any no whose remainder with 2 will be 0
is an even no 

and any no whose remainder with 2 is 1 
will be odd.

eg: 
2, 4, 6,  // even no
1 3 5 7

>>> 5 % 2 = 1 // odd
>>> 4 % 2 = 0 // even 

====================================

TO GET THE LAST DIGIT OF ANY NUMBER WE WILL DO % 10

>>> 123456 % 10 = 6   // gets the last digit

>>> 5678023 % 10 = 3 // gets the last digit


IF WE DO ANY NO mod K then the values will lie between [0 - (K - 1)]
 
>>> n % 10 -> [0 - 9] here K is 10
>>> n % 5  -> [0 - 4] here K is 5
